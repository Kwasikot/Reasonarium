# Reasonarium

Desktop app for rationality training and debate practice. PyQt UI with ChatGPT‑style streaming; works with OpenAI or local Ollama. Prompts are selectable; debate topics can be generated by discipline/subtopic.

---

Quick Start (Python 3.11)
- Create venv and install deps
  - Windows: `py -3.11 -m venv .venv` → `.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1`
  - macOS/Linux: `python3.11 -m venv .venv` → `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install: `python -m pip install -U pip` then `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Configure engines
  - OpenAI: set `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional `USEFULCLICKER_OPENAI_MODEL`, default `gpt-4o-mini`)
  - Ollama: install/run `ollama serve` (default base `http://localhost:11434`); models are read from `/api/tags` or XML fallback
- Run: `python -m app.main`

Features
- Chat UI with streaming and prompt picker (`UsefulPrompts/`)
- Engines: OpenAI or Ollama; model dropdown adapts to engine
- Debate topic dialog: choose Discipline + Subtopic, generate N controversial questions via LLM, pick or write your own
- Language switch (EN/RU) via `settings/reasonarium_settings.xml` (UI texts, prompt mapping, model lists)
- Curiosity Drive tab (simple UI; discipline/subtopic lists from `curiosity_drive_node.py`)
- A/B highlighting in assistant replies (A: yellow counterargument, B: green question)
- Keyboard: Ctrl+Enter to send

Popper Challenge (short)
- Train falsification per Karl Popper.
- Pick Discipline A (optional B). Choose theory type (Trivial → Advanced) and education level (School → PhD).
- App synthesizes a short theory (any style, even whimsical), then you propose a falsification attempt.
- LLM evaluates your attempt on three criteria: predictions, falsifiable experiments, unfalsifiable parts — and gives a brief score.

Tech Skeptic Mode (short)
- Trains “engineering skepticism”: find weak spots in attractive tech descriptions.
- Pick Discipline (MIT‑style list) and Education Level (School/Undergraduate/Graduate/PhD).
- Synthesize technology description: 5–8 sentences with deliberately embedded weaknesses (more subtle at higher levels).
- Write your criticism; use:
  - Analyze my criticism — scores 1–10 and lists strengths/weaknesses/suggestion.
  - Brutal AI critique of technology — pros/cons/recommendations in a tough, constructive tone.
- All outputs stream token‑by‑token and follow the current UI language.

Configuration (XML)
- `settings/reasonarium_settings.xml`
  - UI texts (EN/RU), prompt files per language
  - OpenAI model list (shown in UI)
  - Ollama endpoint and model list (HTTP `/api/tags` or `<fallback_models>`) 

Notes
- Whisper STT (local) is used when Engine=Ollama (requires `ffmpeg`; installs `openai-whisper`). For Engine=OpenAI, STT uses OpenAI.
- Microphone enumeration uses `sounddevice`; errors and missing devices are printed to console.
- Customize prompts by adding `.md` files to `UsefulPrompts/`; press “Reload Prompts” in the app.

Troubleshooting
- OpenAI: check `OPENAI_API_KEY`, proxy (`USEFULCLICKER_OPENAI_PROXY`), and selected model
- Ollama: ensure `ollama serve` and that the model is pulled (e.g., `ollama run llama3.2`)
- Whisper/NumPy: requirements pin `numpy>=2.2,<2.3` (Numba); ensure `ffmpeg` in PATH
